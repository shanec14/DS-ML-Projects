# Immigration Trends Analysis Project

This project investigates immigration trends and their relationship with socioeconomic indicators in Ireland. The analysis utilises data from various sources, including the [Recorded Crime Incidents and Detections](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/rcd06-recorded-crime-incidents-detections-detection-and-crime-rates/resource/c9043e3e-f687-4c1e-a63a-d7eb8b0d64b6) dataset, [Annual Employment Survey](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/annual-employment-survey), and [Estimated Immigration Persons](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/pea24-estimated-immigration-persons-in-april) dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The datasets used in the analysis contain information on the following variables:

- **Recorded Crime Incidents and Detections:** Crime rates in Ireland.
- **Annual Employment Survey:** Employment data in Ireland.
- **Estimated Immigration Persons:** Immigration data in Ireland.

## Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Explore and visualise trends in immigration rates and socioeconomic indicators over the specified time period.
2. Conduct statistical analysis to investigate potential relationships between immigration rates and unemployment rates, as well as immigration rates and crime rates.
3. Evaluate the statistical significance of any observed correlations between immigration and socioeconomic indicators.
